# TKLBAM BACKUP OVERRIDES #
###########################
#
# FILESYSTEM OVERRIDES
# 
#   Override default configurations in /var/lib/tklbam/profile/dirindex.conf
#   
#   This includes or excludes additional files and directories from being 
#   backed up if they've changed since installation.
# 
# Format
#
#   -?/path/to/include/or/exclude
# 
# Gotchas
# 
#   * If you add a directory handled by package management this may break
#     package management on the system you restore to.
#   
#   * Only changes (e.g., new files, edited files, deleted files) from the 
#     base installation are included in a backup.
#
# Examples
#
#   (exclude log files in /var/www) 
#   -/var/www/*/logs
#   
#   (ignores changes to webmin configuration) 
#   -/etc/webmin
#   
#   (include the contents of an external hard disk...) 
#   /mnt/images
 
 
# DATABASE OVERRIDES
# 
#   By default ALL databases are backed up. Adding a positive override 
#   changes the default behavior so that only the database or table 
#   specified in the override is included in the backup.
#   
#   You can mix positive overrides with negative overrides.
# 
# Format
#
#   -?mysql:database[/table]
# 
# Examples
# 
#   (exclude Drupal6 sessions table) 
#   -mysql:drupal6/sessions
# 
#   (only include drupal6 database) 
#   mysql:drupal6
