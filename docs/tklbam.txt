SYNOPSIS

tklbam <command> [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
===========

TKLBAM (TurnKey Linux Backup and Migration), is a smart automated backup
and restore facility for the TurnKey Linux Virtual Appliance Library.

Goals
-----

TKLBAM is designed to provide an efficient system-level backup of
changed files, users, databases and package management state. This
system-level backup can be restored automatically on any installation of
the same type of virtual appliance, regardless of the underlying
hardware or location. The intended result is a functionally equivalent
copy of the original system.

It is also designed to assist in migration of data and system
configurations between different versions of the same type of virtual
appliance though for some applications, additional manual steps, such as
a database schema update, may be required to complete migration between
versions.

Key elements
------------

`TurnKey Hub`: a web service which provides the front-end for backup
management. The user links an appliance to a specific Hub account
identified by an API KEY.

`Backup profile`: describes the installation state for a specific type
and version of appliance. An appropriate profile is downloaded from
the Hub the first time you backup, or as required if there is a
profile update (e.g., bugfix).

`Delta`: a set of changes since installation to files, users, databases
and package management state. This is calculated at backup time by
comparing the current system state to the installation state described
by the backup profile.

`Encryption key`: generated locally on your server and used to directly
encrypt your backup volumes. By default key management is handled
transparently by the Hub. For extra security, the encryption key may
be passphrase protected cryptographically. An escrow key can be
created to protect against data loss in case the password is
forgotten.

`Duplicity`: back-end primitive that the backup and restore operations
invoke to encode, transfer and decode encrypted backup volumes which
contain the delta. It communicates directly with the storage target
(e.g., Amazon S3). In normal usage the storage target is
auto-configured by the Hub. Duplicity uses the rsync algorithm to
support efficient incremental backups. It uses GnuPG for symmetric
encryption (AES).

`Amazon S3`: a highly-durable cloud storage service where encrypted
backup volumes are uploaded to by default. To improve network
performance, backups are routed to the closest datacenter, based on
a GeoIP lookup table. 

Any storage target supported by Duplicity can be forced but this
complicates usage as the Hub can only work with S3. This means
backups, encryption keys and authentication credentials will need to
be managed by hand. 

Principle of operation
----------------------

Every TKLBAM-supported TurnKey appliance has a corresponding backup
profile that describes installation state and includes an
appliance-specific list of files and directories to check for changes.
This list does not include any files or directories maintained by the
package management system.

A delta (I.e., changeset) is calculated by comparing the current system
state to the installation state. Only this delta is backed up and only
this delta is re-applied on restore.

An exception is made with regards to database contents. These are backed
up and restored whole, unless otherwise configured by the user.

In addition to direct filesystem changes to user writeable directories
(e.g., /etc, /var/www, /home) the backup delta is calculated to include
a list of any new packages not originally in the appliance's
installation manifest. During restore, the package management system is
leveraged to install these new packages from the configured software
repositories.

Users and groups from the backed up system are merged on restore. If
necessary, uids / gids of restored files and directories are remapped to
maintain correct ownership.

Similarly, permissions for files and directories are adjusted as
necessary to match permissions on the backed up system.

EXAMPLE USAGE SCENARIO
======================

Alon is developing a new web site. He starts by deploying TurnKey LAMP
to a virtual machine running on his laptop. This will serve as his local
development server. He names it DevBox.

He customizes DevBox as follows:

* creates user alon.
* extracting an archive of his web application to /var/www
* tweaking Apache configuration directives in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
  until his web application works.
* installing php5-xcache via the package manager
* enabling xcache by editing a section in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
* creating a new database user with reduced privileges for his web
  application.
* configuring and installing the web application, which creates a new
  MySQL database.

After a few days of hacking on the web application, Alon is ready to
show off a prototype of his creation to some friends from out of town.

He logs into the TurnKey Hub and launches a new TurnKey LAMP server in
the Amazon EC2 cloud. He names it CloudBox. 

On both DevBox and CloudBox Alon installs and initializes TKLBAM with
the following commands::

    apt-get update
    apt-get install tklbam

    # The API Key is needed to link tklbam to Alon's Hub account
    tklbam-init QPINK3GD7HHT3A

On DevBox Alon runs a backup::

    root@DevBox:~# tklbam-backup

Behind the scenes, TKLBAM downoads from the Hub a profile for the
version of TurnKey LAMP Alon is using. The profile describes the state
of DevBox right after installation, before Alon customized it. This
allows TKLBAM to detect all the files and directories that Alon has
added or edited since. Any new packages Alon installed are similarly
detected.

As for his MySQL databases, it's all taken care of transparently but if
Alon dug deeper he would discover that their full contents are being
serialized and encoded into a special file structure optimized for
efficiency on subsequent incremental backups. Between backups Alon
usually only updates a handful of tables and rows, so the following
incremental backups are very small, just a few KBs!

When TKLBAM is done calculating the delta and serializing database
contents, it invokes Duplicity to encode backup contents into a chain of
encrypted backup volumes which are uploaded to Amazon S3.

When Alon's first backup is complete, a new record shows up in the
Backups section of his TurnKey Hub account.

Now to restore the DevBox backup on CloudBox::

    root@CloudBox:~# tklbam-list
    # ID  SKPP  Created     Updated     Size (GB)  Label
       1  No    2010-09-01  2010-09-01  0.02       TurnKey LAMP

    root@CloudBox:~# tklbam-restore 1

When the restore is done Alon points his browser to CloudBox's IP
address and is delighted to see his web application running there,
exactly the same as it does on DevBox.

Alon, a tinkerer at heart, is curious to learn more about how the backup
and restore process works. By default, the restore process reports what
it's doing verbosely to the screen. But Alon had a hard time following
the output in real time, because everything happened so fast!
Thankfully, all the output is also saved to a log file at
/var/log/tklbam-restore. 

Alon consults the log file and can see that only the files he added or
changed on DevBox were restored to CloudBox. Database state was
unserialized. The xcache package was installed via the package manager.
User alon was recreated. It's uid didn't conflict with any other
existing user on CloudBox so the restore process didn't need to remap it
to another uid and fix ownership of Alon's files. Not that it would
matter to Alon either way. It's all automagic.
