SYNOPSIS
========

tklbam-set-fallback [ `FALLBACK-ACCESS-KEY` ] [ `FALLBACK-SECRET-KEY` ]

This is used to setup fallback credentials used when access to the Hub is limited
or not possible.

ARGUMENTS
=========

`FALLBACK-ACCESS-KEY`	Your IAMUser access key
`FALLBACK-SECRET-KEY` 	Your IAMUser secret access key

If you do not provide FALLBACK-ACCESS-KEY and/or FALLBACK-SECRET-KEY you will be
prompted for it/them interactively.

SECURITY WARNING
================

Providing your AWS IAMUser credentials as a commandline argument is potentially less secure
than allowing tklbam-set-fallback to prompt you for it interactively.

* The shell may save the credentials in its history file (e.g. ~/.bash_history)
* The credentials may briefly show up in the process list.

AWS IAMUser credentials must exist on your system in plaintext as they are intended to work
even when you can only access your AWS bucket and should work automatically without
interaction.
