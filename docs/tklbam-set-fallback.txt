SYNOPSIS
========

tklbam-set-fallback [ `FALLBACK-ACCESS-KEY` ] [ `FALLBACK-SECRET-KEY` ]

This is used to setup fallback credentials used when access to the Hub is limited
or not possible.

ARGUMENTS
=========

`FALLBACK-ACCESS-KEY`   Your IAMUser access key
`FALLBACK-SECRET-KEY`   Your IAMUser secret access key

If you do not provide FALLBACK-ACCESS-KEY and/or FALLBACK-SECRET-KEY you will be
prompted for it/them interactively.

SECURITY WARNING
================

Providing your AWS IAMUser credentials as a commandline argument is potentially less secure
than allowing tklbam-set-fallback to prompt you for it interactively.

* The shell may save the credentials in its history file (e.g. ~/.bash_history)
* The credentials may briefly show up in the process list.

AWS IAMUser credentials exist on your system in plaintext. This is to allow backups to work
seamlessly without interaction.
