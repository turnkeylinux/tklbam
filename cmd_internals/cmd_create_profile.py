Create custom backup profile

What is a backup profile?

A backup profile is used to calculate the list of system changes that need to
be backed up (e.g., new files and packages). It typically describes the
installation state of the system and includes 3 files:

* dirindex.conf: list of filesystem paths to scan for changes
* dirindex: index of timestamps, ownership and permissions for dirindex.conf
            paths
* packages: list of currently installed packages.

What file paths should a backup profile keep track of?

It depends on what you're using TKLBAM for. If you want to use it like TurnKey
take a look at the dirindex.conf file in the "core" profile, which all
appliance backup profiles inherit from.

In principle, we want to track changes to the user-servicable, customizable
parts of the filesystem (e.g., /etc /root /home /var /usr/local /var /opt /srv)
while ignoring changes in areas maintained by the package management system.
The "Filesystem Hierarchy Standard" describes the Linux filesystem structure.

Why not backup everything?

TKLBAM was originaly designed to make it easy for users to only backup the
delta (I.e., changes) from a fixed installation base (I.e., an appliance). In
this usage scenario, less is more.

By default we only backup your data and configurations, plus a list of new
packages you've installed. Later when you restore these will be overlaid on top
of the new appliance's filesystem and the package management system will be
asked to install the missing packages.

By contrast, If you backup the entire filesystem TKLBAM won't be able to help
you migrate your data and configurations to a newer version of an appliance.
The restore will just run everything over. At best you'll end up with the old
appliance in a new location. But more likely you'll end up mixing the old and
new filesystems and break the package management system.

Arguments:

    <conf>          Path to configuration file with list of includes/exclude
                    paths ('-' for stdin input)

Options:

    -f --force      Overwrite non-empty directories

    --no-packages   Don't create a list of installed packages from
                    /var/lib/dpkg/status

                    Without this we won't be able to detect which packages have
                    changed since the profile was generated so the backup will
                    include all currently installed packages.

    --no-dirindex   Don't create an index of file timestamps, ownerships and
                    permissions.

                    Without this we won't be able to detect changes since the
                    profile was generated so the backup will include everything
                    wholesale.
                    (e.g., all files in /etc vs only files in /etc that have
                    changed)

    --root=PATH     Use this as the root path, instead of /
                    This is useful for generating backup profiles for chroot
                    filesystems


Usage examples:

    # create my-custom-profile by profiling state of files in the paths in
    # profile.conf
    echo /etc -/etc/.git > profile.conf
    tklbam-internal create-profile my-custom-profile/ profile.conf

    # same as above but read paths to profile from stdin instead of a file
    echo /etc -/etc/.git \
            | tklbam-internal create-profile -- my-custom-profile/ -
